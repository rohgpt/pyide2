## Future Scope
1. Most Difficult part is to add compiler and interpreter to text editor but this can be done for providing running code facility to programmer.
2. Currently Identifier highlighting is done only for C language , this can be done for other language too.
3. Adding other editor feature like font size, Tab size, intellisense.
